# 001 - Yii goal and values

## Goal

The Yii project aims to build and maintain _practical_ and _helpful_ tools and community.

## Values

The values we express in our work support the goal. We try to

- Be Practical
    - [High Performance](#high-performance)
    - [Sensible Defaults and Flexibility](#sensible-defaults-and-flexibility)
    - [Practice-orientation](#practice-orientation)
- Be Helpful
    - [Be simple](#simplicity)
    - [Be explicit](#explicitness)
    - [Be consistent](#consistency)
    
## Be Practical

### High Performance

Performance is a necessary condition of practicality. Software should not waste machine or human resources.

### Sensible Defaults and Flexibility

We prefer sensible defaults and conventions that users can customize. We seek a balance between flexibility, discipline and simplicity that meets common needs.

### Be practice-oriented

We prefer practice over theory. For example:

- Solutions for known use cases should avoid excess complexity by providing only needed flexibility.
- Standard implementations should take practical use into account.
- Experience is at least as useful as theory in guiding design.
- Context is critical in determiniung appropriateness.

## Be Helpful

This value guides technical decisions as well as community activity. Consideration of how software features help users should guide development. Community-wise, we value any helpful contribution, be it a
pull request or an answer in the forum.

When the other principles could conflict, we choose a solution that is more helpful to the community.

### Simplicity

Solutions should be simple yet elegant:

- We add complexity where necessary and avoid it otherwise.
- We do not tolerate ugly solutions unless there is no other way.
- Less rules are better than more rules.

### Explicitness

We prefer explicit solutions and code.

For example:

- Straightforward solution is better than over-abstracted one. That is not an excuse not to abstract though.
- Typecasting is better than type coercion, type-hinting is better than no type hinting.
- No magic unless necessary.
- Loud fails are preferred to silent fails.

### Consistency

We try being consistent in everything:

- Code style.
- Naming.
- Design.
- Structure.
